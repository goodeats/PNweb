    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>I am a web developer. I will try things here.</p>
    <p>I am happily working at <a href="http://www.ditto.us.com" class="page-link">Ditto Labs</a> where I work mainly on front-end development.</p>
    <h2>background</h2>
    <p>I became a web developer in 2015 after working my young professional life in financial services. I was last managing operations of a platform of retail alternative investments (i.e., hedge funds, private equity) with a degree in Finance from Bentley University.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed mastering a complex environment by delivering user friendly information catered to many different clients, partners, and team members with speed and efficiency. As critical situations would emerge, I was "the guy" to handle it.</p>
    <h2>career change</h2>
    <p>But money has existed for centuries. I'm only here for so long so I might as well build something to show for it. My favorite skills to use are creativity and resourcefulness and I didn't want to set a limit on their potential.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the ongoing tech boom, I realized that our future will be fully digitial and automated. There will be more content to publish and consume. There will be more pain points to solve. There will be more interaction and knowledge. I wanted to spend my time working on these advancements. So I decided to become a web developer.</p>
    <p>I started by going to coffee shops before and after work to learn to code. I was caught in the "if you don't use it, do you lose it?" phase having limited hours to learn something brand new when it would hard to pick up quickly where I left off. So I decided to dive in full time.</p>
    <p>I completed General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" class="page-link">Web Development Immersive</a> program to learn best practices in a focussed environment. It was the best decision I've ever made. I am now a full-stack web developer capable of building a platform like Twitter (had it not already been created). I am working for a <a href="http://www.ditto.us.com" class="page-link">great startup</a> where I now get to build on a number of unique products.</p>
